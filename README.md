Overview
------------------------

This is a module designed to implement TEvA on a series of Wikipedia summaries. It
depends on TEvA, as well as COS and iGraph/Maximal Cliques. 

The properties file contains several parameters that can help debug.

The Python script, WikiCorpus, should be used on a Wiki dump to create a summary corpus,
and subsequent CSV and Reference files.
